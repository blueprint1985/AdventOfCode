# Advent of code

My solutions for problems at [http://adventofcode.com/2017]

### Usage 2015 and 2016

Go to the specific problem folder and run `php [dayXX_YY.php]` where XX is the day number (00-25) and YY is the part (1 or 2)

### Usage 2017

2017 problems are run directly from the 2017 folder. See Readme in folder.

##### Requirements

2017 problems may require PHP 7.0 or later due to type hinting.
